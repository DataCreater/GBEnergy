# GBEnergy

An ontology of the Retail Energy Market of Great Britain created by Lidcast Data Limited.

The purpose of the ontology is to explain how the major elements of the Retail Energy Market relate. As far as possible terminology is consistent with industry codes and regulation at the time of its creation.

OWL files may be loaded into an ontology editor such as Protege (recommended) or Topbraid, an ontology visualisation tool such as WebVOWL, or a graph database such as GraphDB. There is a dependency on gistCore9.7.0, which can be obtained from https://github.com/semanticarts/gist

Some visualisation files are included that have been generated from the Protege OWLVIZ plugin. They should give a ready indication of the scope of the domain. 

You can contribute by submitting issues and discussion threads.
